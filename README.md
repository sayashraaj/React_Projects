#Saarang_DevOps

Using React, I have made a React App which meets all the requirements asked for in the application for Saarang DevOps Coord

The app has form, which validates:
-Name
- Roll Number
- Contact Number (checks for 10 digits) 
- Email ID (checks for smail ID using '@smail.iitm.ac.in')
- Password
- Confirm Password (Checks if password===confirmpassword field input)

On clicking the 'Submit' button, onClick corresponds to a  validation function which checks if there are any errors flagged by the individual error checking functions, and if there are, it displays the errors and resets the form's input values to the initialState

When validation is successful, it redirects to a new page '/FetchRandomUser' where the endpoint '/welcome' to https://saarang2021aspirers.herokuapp.com gives the .treasure value for moviename
the endpoint obtained from the first endpoint gives the next .treasure value tvseriesname
the endponit obtained from the second endpoint gives the next endpoint for a list which is stored and displayed using a 'map' function in cards I created using only div tags

This is my React App, my Saarang DevOps app, and I hope you like the result of five days of hardwork I have put into making the project, learning react from scratch

I really want to be the Saarang DevOps coordinator
